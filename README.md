Hi there! I'm Joan, and I love coding and being creative. I'm currently studying in my last year of high school, but I have learnt how to code on my own 😌.

I can do a lot of things:
- Code in C++, Python (and Flask),  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Design in Figma (check out [one of my designs](https://joanriosipla.github.io/AgentTruk/))
- I'm also learning React and Node.
- Not related, but I love pixel art, and now I'm learning to draw "properly", with pen and paper.

Please, check out some of my cool projects 🥺:
- [My own card game (ft. My lovely sis)](https://joanriosipla.github.io/AgentTruk/)
- [Beneit.cat](https://joanriosipla.github.io/BENEIT/) (Not paying the domain anymore)
- [Scratch games](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/coyote_coyota/)
